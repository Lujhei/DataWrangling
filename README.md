<b><u>Data Wrangling for Tidy Data</b></u>

<b>Why?</b>

It's suggested that Data Wrangling takes up 50-80% of a Data Analyst's working time. By presenting data in a clean format, it facillitates the subsequent exploration and analysis, collaboration with others, and allows for exchange between different tools (in this case R).

This is a demonstration of some of the principles and practices. 

<b>How?</b>

The method employed in this repo will follow guidelines set for Tidy data:
1. Each variable forms a column
2. Each observation forms a row
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table

In particular, this repo will address how to handle some common problems seen in messy data using R:
1. Column headers are values, not variable names
2. Multiple variables in one column
3. Variables stored in both rows and columns
4. Multiple types of observational units in one table
5. Single observational unit in multiple tables
